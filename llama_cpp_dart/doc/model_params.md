This class is designed for configuring how a Llama model is split and operated across multiple GPUs. Here's a brief overview:

1. **Class Description**: `ModelParams` configures the operational parameters for a Llama model, especially in multi-GPU environments. It includes settings for tensor splitting, metadata overrides, GPU layer storage, and memory management options.

2. **Properties**:
   - **tensorSplit**: List indicating how the model (layers or rows) is distributed across GPUs.
   - **metadataOverride**: Map for overriding key-value pairs of the model metadata.
   - **gpuLayerLayer**: The number of layers to store in VRAM, defaulting to 99.
   - **mainGpu**: Determines which GPU is used based on the split mode.
   - **vocabOnly**: Boolean flag to load only the vocabulary without weights.
   - **useMemorymap**: Boolean flag to use memory mapping if possible.
   - **useMemoryLock**: Boolean flag to keep the model in RAM.

3. **Constructor**: Initializes the `_tensorSplitPointer` and attaches it to the finalizer for memory management.

4. **Methods**:
   - **dispose()**: Releases allocated resources.
   - **get()**: Constructs and returns a `llama_model_params` object based on current settings.
   - **fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json)**: Factory constructor to create an instance from a JSON map.
   - **toJson()**: Converts the instance into a JSON map for serialization or debugging.
   - **toString()**: Provides a string representation of the instance, useful for logging or debugging.

5. **Memory Management**: The class uses the Dart FFI (Foreign Function Interface) to allocate and manage native memory for the tensor split pointers and metadata overrides.
